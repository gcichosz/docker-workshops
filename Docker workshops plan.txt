Requirements:
  * Docker for Windows (keep Linux containers!)
  * Github account
  * docker pull (list of images)
  * docker hub account

How Docker can help us developers:
  * use it as system requirements for the application
  * distribute application within a team
  * forget about different environment versions on your local machine
  * safe sand-boxing
  * forget about build tools at all on your local machine
  * build a CI/CD pipeline within it, and have pipeline config as code
  * run application in an environment exactly like on production
