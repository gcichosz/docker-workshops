How Docker can help us developers:
  * use it as system requirements for the application
  * distribute application within a team
  * forget about different environment versions on your local machine
  * safe sand-boxing
  * forget about build tools at all on your local machine
  * build a CI/CD pipeline within it, and have pipeline config as code
  * run application in an environment exactly like on production
